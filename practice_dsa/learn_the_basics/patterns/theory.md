# Patterns

Loops are important are the building blocks of DSA. Patterns are a great way to practice loops and understand how they work. Here are some common patterns that you can practice.

## 4 Steps to solve any pattern problem
1. Outer loop: Count the number of rows.
2. Inner loop: focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows
3. Whatever you are printing, print them inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry [ optional: only for some patterns]
