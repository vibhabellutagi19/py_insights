```python
Cards = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])
```

The line of code you've selected is using the namedtuple function from Python's built-in collections module to define a new type of object called `Card`.

`namedtuple` is a function that generates a subclass of tuple with named fields. This means you can create a tuple where each element can be accessed through a `unique (human-readable) name`, in addition to its index.

In your code, `namedtuple` is being called with two arguments: 'Card' and ['rank', 'suit']. The first argument is a string that defines the name of the new type. The second argument is a list of strings that define the names of the fields for the new type.

So, ```Cards = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])``` is creating a new type called Card where each Card object will have two fields: rank and suit.

Once this line has been executed, you can create new Card objects like this: card = Cards('Queen', 'Hearts'). You can access the fields of a Card object either by name (card.rank and card.suit) or by index (card[0] and card[1]).

### How collections.namedtuple is different from a regular tuple?

 A `namedtuple` in Python is a subclass of a regular tuple, but it has a few key differences:

1. **Field Names**: In a regular tuple, you access the elements using their indices. For example, if `t` is a tuple, you would use `t[0]` to access the first element. In a `namedtuple`, you can also access elements by their name. For example, if `card` is a `namedtuple` with a field named `rank`, you can use `card.rank` to access the `rank` field.

2. **Readability**: `namedtuple` makes your code more readable. When you see a regular tuple, you might not know what the data represents without comments or context. With a `namedtuple`, the field names provide context about what each element in the tuple represents.

3. **Immutability**: Like regular tuples, `namedtuple` instances are immutable. This means that once they're created, they can't be modified. This can be useful in situations where you want to ensure that an object doesn't change after it's created.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```python
# Regular tuple
regular_tuple = ('Queen', 'Hearts')
print(regular_tuple[0])  # 'Queen'

# namedtuple
Card = collections.namedtuple('Card', ['rank', 'suit'])
named_tuple = Card('Queen', 'Hearts')
print(named_tuple.rank)  # 'Queen'
```

In the `namedtuple` example, it's clear that 'Queen' represents the rank of a card, whereas in the regular tuple example, you would need additional context to know what 'Queen' represents.
